Outside my job I like to travel, listen to music, go to concerts but also help in a non-profit radio station called CUAC FM. Its a community media station where all people can do its own radio show. In the station there are tons of things to do on tech. When I have time I also like to check new technologies like Flutter or play a bit with the 3D printer.

I love having fun everyday. With my friends, my coworkers or my family. Fun, fun, fun!! I think fun is the engine for everything. It balances the world.
