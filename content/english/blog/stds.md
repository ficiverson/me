I want to explain **how I helped two doctors** (Ana and Elvira) **and a teacher** (Angel) to build an app to show some important information about **STDs and how to prevent unintended pregnancy in young people** (the app is in Galician and Spanish but we are open to update the content to English or any other language if someone can help us).
>  This app is intended to young people (16+) that can have risky sex relations to prevent STD and also unintended pregnancy.
>  According to CDC, the STDs are rising and its important to help young people to understand how easy they can reduce the risk in their relations. [https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0413-stds.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0413-stds.html)

After iterating a lot with the content to show a **brief summary of the info** (the exercise to show medical info as in social networks was tremendous) the **doctors ensure to show all the important topics** (show a basic info was crucial to avoid misunderstandings).

We end up with a **modern UI/UX solution **made with **Flutter 💙**

Every app I can write with **Dart/Flutter,** I can enjoy *more and more* with this awesome *framework*. I think that the ability to **iterate with every widget **and try new *innovate* things is the **path for modern mobile apps**.

## Home screen

**The proposal** was to use **swipe** **cards** as in **dating apps** to show images as part of the information to keep in touch with the **young audience**. I have to give credit here to Dre and Fer for the imagery.

In the current roadmap is to launch **web and other platforms** reusing the current codebase as one of the main features of **Flutter**.

## Morning after pill

**Another amazing feature** of the app is a map with the **nearest public points to get the morning after pill for free**. This feature is only available with the **centres of Galicia (Spain)** but we are happy to update with other countries if some **public organisation** can provide the info to us.

## Locations of medical care

**Another feature** of the app is to show clear information on **how to proceed** if you think you can have an **STD disease**. As we said in the app the most important thing after reading this information is:
>  “Please, visit your doctor!!”

## STD information

**Another amazing feature** of the app is the **Mythbuster**. In this section of the app we fight agains *fake news and myths* so we **explain some myths about risky sex relations. As you can see the Mythbuster** is a **doctor** because the science is the only one that can answer this kind of questions.

**This section is crucial. I love it**.

## Mythbuster

**The other feature** of the app is a full list of **contraception methods**. The user can see all the information on how does it work, how to use it and as we say always:
>  “In case of doubts: visit your doctor!!”

## Birth control methods

**I am really happy** that I could help a bit with this small tech piece because for me was really easy to implement this app with Flutter but I think this is a big step **to reach all the young people** with important information.

As Ana and Elvira said to me first time we met:
>  We worked for many years in this field but we don’t know how to reach the young people with new technologies

## How to use it

Feel free to **share this app** with all the people you know it can be helpful ❤️. We will share the repo in **github** to share all, in case someone wants to put more features into the app.

**Final note:** We got a mention from the Ministry of Health of Spain in sharing good practices in the risky sex relations: [https://www.mscbs.gob.es/organizacion/sns/planCalidadSNS/pdf/BBPP_2019/BBPP_SS_2019/Galicia_BBPP_SS.pdf](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/organizacion/sns/planCalidadSNS/pdf/BBPP_2019/BBPP_SS_2019/Galicia_BBPP_SS.pdf)
