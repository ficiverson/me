Thank you for using fernandosouto.dev! Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our open-source software and services. By using our software, you agree to the practices outlined in this policy.

1. Data Collection

We are committed to minimizing the data we collect. Here is what we collect and how we use it:

a. Usage Data

We may collect basic, anonymized usage data to improve our software. This data is stored locally on your device or server and is not transmitted to us or any third party unless you explicitly choose to share it.

b. Voluntary Information

If you contact us directly, such as through email or support forums, we may collect your name, email address, and any other information you choose to provide. This information is only used to respond to your inquiries and is never shared or sold.

2. Data Storage

All data collected or generated by the software is stored locally on your device or server. We do not have access to this data unless you choose to share it with us explicitly.

3. No Third-Party Tracking

We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking tools in our software. Your usage of our software is private and not monitored by external entities.

4. Open Source Philosophy

As an open-source project, our source code is publicly available and can be reviewed to verify compliance with this Privacy Policy. Transparency is a core value of our work, and we encourage independent audits and community feedback.

5. Your Choices and Controls

Local Data: You can view, modify, or delete any data stored locally on your device or server at any time.

No Opt-In Required: Since we do not collect or transmit personal data, there is no need to opt into or out of any data collection policies.

6. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the software and any local data it generates. However, the security of your device and network is your responsibility. We recommend keeping your software and systems up to date.

7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
